RAINLINK: Retrieval algorithm for rainfall mapping from microwave links in a cellular communication network.
------

This software can be employed to obtain rainfall estimates from signal level data from commercial microwave links (CML) in cellular communication networks.

RAINLINK version 1.3 works with new(er) versions of proj4 and gdal libraries and works in principle as of R version 4. Note that RAINLINK version 1.3 has been tested, but that additional tests are ongoing. Up to now, differences between output of version 1.2 and 1.3 are minor. The old version 1.21 remains available on GitHub (https://github.com/overeem11/RAINLINK/tree/v.1.21; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5907524). RAINLINK version 1.3 does not contain any visualization functions anymore. Note that the plotting of data availability (''DataAvailability.R'') and topology (''Topology.R'') have been kept. Python software MapRAINLINK is now publicly available to visualize rain gauge, radar, and commercial microwave link (CML) locations and their rainfall estimates on a map (https://github.com/overeem11/MapRAINLINK).

See documents ManualRAINLINK.pdf and RAINLINK1.3.pdf for extensive descriptions of RAINLINK and how to use it.
