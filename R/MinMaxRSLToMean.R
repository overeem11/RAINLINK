#' Subfunction for path-averaged rainfall estimation from minimum and maximum attenuations 
#' from microwave links.
#' @description Subfunction for path-averaged rainfall estimation using microwave links. 
#' Compute minimum (Amin) and maximum (Amax) attenuation over the link path. Convert these to minimum and 
#' maximum path-averaged rainfall intensities. Convert minimum and maximum path-averaged 
#' rainfall intensities to mean path-averaged rainfall intensities. 
#'
#' Works for a sampling strategy where minimum and maximum received signal powers
#' are provided, and the transmitted power levels are constant.
#'
#' Also works for a sampling strategy where instantaneous transmitted and received signal levels are obtained.
#' In case of instantaneous signal levels, it does not matter whether transmitted power levels vary or are constant.
#' The only requirement is that the input data for RAINLINK needs some preprocessing. See ''ManualRAINLINK.pdf''
#' for instructions. 
#' 
#' Also works for a sampling strategy where average transmitted and received signal levels are obtained.
#' In case of average signal levels, it does not matter whether transmitted power levels vary or are constant.
#' The only requirement is that the input data for RAINLINK needs some preprocessing. See ''ManualRAINLINK.pdf''
#' for instructions. 
#'
#' @param a Coefficients in relationship between rainfall intensity and specific 
#' attenuation (mm h\eqn{^{-1}} dB\eqn{^{-b}} km\eqn{^{b}}).
#' @param Aa Wet antenna attenuation correction \eqn{A_{\mbox{a}}} (dB).
#' @param alpha Coefficient (\eqn{\alpha}) determining contribution of minimum and 
#' maximum path-averaged rainfall intensity to mean path-averaged rainfall intensity (-).
#' @param b Exponents in relationship between rainfall intensity and specific attenuation (-).
#' @param PathLength Lengths of link paths (km).
#' @return Data frame with mean path-averaged rainfall intensities (mm h\eqn{^{-1}}).
