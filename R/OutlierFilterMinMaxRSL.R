#' Function to apply filter to remove outliers in path-averaged microwave link attenuations.
#' @description Function to apply filter to remove outliers in link-based rainfall estimates. 
#' Malfunctioning link antennas can cause outliers in rainfall retrievals (especially for 
#' daily accumulations). These outliers can be removed by using a filter that is based on the 
#' assumption that rainfall is correlated in space. The filter discards a time interval of a 
#' link for which the cumulative difference between its specific attenuation and that of the 
#' surrounding links over the previous 24 h (including the present time interval), F, becomes 
#' lower than a threshold value in dB h km\eqn{^{-1}}. 
#'
#' Works for a sampling strategy where minimum and maximum received signal powers
#' are provided, and the transmitted power levels are constant.
#'
#' The outlier filter has been extensively tested on minimum received signal powers, i.e.
#' for a sampling strategy where minimum and maximum received signal powers
#' are provided, and the transmitted power levels are constant.
#' This function can also be applied in case of other sampling strategies, because
#' it does not explicitly require minimum and maximum received signal powers.
#' It just applies the selection on all rows in a data frame.
#' Whether the outlier filter will give good results when applied to link data
#' obtained from other sampling strategies would need to be tested.
#' Hence, ''MinMaxRSL'' is kept in this function name to stress that it
#' has been tested for a sampling strategy where minimum and maximum received 
#' powers are provided.
#'
#' Also works for a sampling strategy where instantaneous transmitted and received signal levels are obtained.
#' In case of instantaneous signal levels, it does not matter whether transmitted power levels vary or are constant.
#' The only requirement is that the input data for RAINLINK needs some preprocessing. See ''ManualRAINLINK.pdf''
#' for instructions. 
#'
#' Also works for a sampling strategy where average transmitted and received signal levels are obtained.
#' In case of average signal levels, it does not matter whether transmitted power levels vary or are constant.
#' The only requirement is that the input data for RAINLINK needs some preprocessing. See ''ManualRAINLINK.pdf''
#' for instructions. 
#'
#' Can only be applied when function WetDryNearbyLinkApMinMaxRSL has been executed.

#' @param Data Data frame with microwave link data.
