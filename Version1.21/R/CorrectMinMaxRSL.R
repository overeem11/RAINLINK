#' Function for correcting minimum and maximum received signal powers. 
#' @description Function for correcting minimum (Pmin) and maximum (Pmax) received signal powers.
#' For a rainy time interval the corrected minimum received signal power becomes equal to 
#' the minimum received signal power if this is below the reference signal level (Pref). 
#' Otherwise the corrected minimum received signal power becomes equal to the 
#' reference signal level. The corrected maximum received signal power becomes
#' equal to the maximum received signal power if both the maximum received signal 
#' power and the corrected minimum received signal power are below the reference
#' signal level.
#'
#' Works for a sampling strategy where minimum and maximum received signal powers
#' are provided, and the transmitted power levels are constant.
#'
#' Also works for a sampling strategy where instantaneous transmitted and received signal levels are obtained.
#' In case of instantaneous signal levels, it does not matter whether transmitted power levels vary or are constant.
#' The only requirement is that the input data for RAINLINK needs some preprocessing. See ''ManualRAINLINK.pdf''
#' for instructions. 
#'
#' Also works for a sampling strategy where average transmitted and received signal levels are obtained.
#' In case of average signal levels, it does not matter whether transmitted power levels vary or are constant.
#' The only requirement is that the input data for RAINLINK needs some preprocessing. See ''ManualRAINLINK.pdf''
#' for instructions. 
#'
#' @param Data Data frame with microwave link data.
#' @param Dry Data frame: Should interval be considered dry for reference level
#' determination? (0 = wet; 1 = dry). Use Dry=NULL if no wet-dry classification
#' has been performed.
#' @param Pref Reference level (dB).
#' @return Data frame with corrected minimum and maximum received powers (dB).
