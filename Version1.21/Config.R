# For OpenStreetMap the maps may reach resolutions of 1500 - 2000 pixels. Hence, using FigWidth and FigHeight

ScaleTopDaily <- 26		# mm
# Sometimes the legend is not correctly plotted. In that case try other values for ScaleTop and/or ScaleBottom.

# Another way to prevent this is to manually provide the legend breaks:
ManualScale <- "no"	# If "no", manual scale below is not used, and interval breaks are determined automatically. 
# For not equal to "no", interval breaks are determined manually:
ScaleLow <- c(ScaleBottomDaily,6,11,16,21)	# or ScaleBottomTimeStep instead of ScaleBottomDaily.
ScaleHigh <- c(6,11,16,21,ScaleTopDaily)	# or ScaleTopTimeStep instead of ScaleTopDaily.
# Please note that in case of x values in ColoursNumber, ScaleLow and ScaleHigh should also contain x values!
# So, in case you change the number of values in ScaleLow and ScaleHigh: do not forget to change the number for ColoursNumber above accordingly,
# and be aware that the number of colors in ColourScheme below, when given as a list of hexadecimal codes or names, should also change accordingly.
# Example for time steps:
#ScaleBottomTimeStep <- 0.1	# mm. 
#ScaleTopTimeStep <- 10.1	# mm.
#ScaleLow <- c(ScaleBottomTimeStep,2.1,4.1,6.1,8.1)	
#ScaleHigh <- c(2.1,4.1,6.1,8.1,ScaleTopTimeStep)



# Let R automatically define highest value of legend (choose "yes"):
AutDefineLegendTop <- "no"
# In case of "yes" the highest class is not plotted anymore. This is also the case if ManualScale is not equal to "no", although
# the higest value of legend is then determined by ScaleTopDaily.



# Choose colour scheme by using hexadecimal codes or names:
ColourScheme <- rainbow(ColoursNumber+1)
ColourScheme <- c("#DBEED3","#9CD5C4","#71B5C7","#858AC1","#A2569C","#96344E")
