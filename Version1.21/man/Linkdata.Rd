\title{Microwave link dataset from which path-averaged rainfall intensities
can be computed. Received signal powers were obtained from Nokia microwave 
links in one of the national cellular communication networks in The Netherlands,
operated by T-Mobile NL. The minimum and maximum received powers over 15-min 
intervals were provided, based on 10-Hz sampling. The transmitted power was almost 
constant. Here the data have a resolution of 1 dB, and the majority of these Nokia 
links used vertically polarised signals.}

\usage{
data(Linkdata)

\description{
Data were obtained from September 9, 0800 UTC - September 11, 0800 UTC (2011).
The data set contains data from 2612 microwave links.
}
\details{
Several functions in the RAINLINK package read a data frame with microwave
link data. Such a data frame always contains the variables as indicated
below, i.e. the variables in the data set supplied to PreprocessingMinMaxRSL.

For each link and time interval the following variables are provided: 

\itemize{
  \item Frequency: microwave frequency f (GHz).
  \item DateTime: date and end time of observation (YYYYMMDDhhmm, i.e. year 
(2011), month (09), day (11), hour (08), minutes (00): 201109110800).
  \item Pmin: minimum received power P\eqn{_{\mbox{min}}} (dBm).
  \item Pmax: maximum received power P\eqn{_{\mbox{max}}} (dBm).
  \item PathLength: length of microwave link path L (km).
  \item XStart: Longitude of start of links (\eqn{^{\circ}}; WGS84).
  \item YStart: Latitude of start of links (\eqn{^{\circ}}; WGS84).
  \item XEnd: Longitude of end of links (\eqn{^{\circ}}; WGS84).
  \item YEnd: Latitude of end of links (\eqn{^{\circ}}; WGS84).
  \item ID: Link identifier.
